%% Abstract section.
\abstract{We demonstrate the feasibility of analyzing in real time eye-tracking data captured from  multiple people concurrently using an interactive visualization. We leverage the Data of Interest (DOI) approach, in which gaze coordinates are related to a visualizationâ€™s content as it is rendered, to produce a granular list of data objects that users are interested in at any given time. Unlike traditional eye-tracking analyses, which rely heavily on manual annotation and require the display of visual stimuli used in data collection, the DOI approach allows us to collect data that is readily meaningful, and for which we can create visual representations that are sufficiently compact to show data from multiple users at the same time.  We show in a controlled user study that analysts were able to interpret real-time DOI streams from five users concurrently and to determine what tasks those users were doing. We discuss potential applications of our methods in teaching and the development of gaze-contingent visualizations.
