We collected data from 11 subjects (C-subjects) in our current study (C-study). Each of them used our analysis tool to get a sense of the data from the previous user study (P-study). We asked C-subjects to analyze data of four kinds of tasks from P-study (P-task) which were their tasks in their C-study (C-task). All of the C-tasks were related to one of the P-tasks in the C-study.  
\begin{itemize}
	\item P-task 1: Given a brief and incomplete description of the ``Brat Pack'', a group of young actors popular in the 80's, previous subjects (P-subjects) were asked to find additional members and movies they acted in. 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item C-task 1.1:  Finding the three actors which were mentioned to the P-subjects.
			\item C-task 1.2:  Finding three movies related with the mentioned actors.
			\item C-task 1.3:  Rating the performances of P-subjects based on their data.
		\end{itemize}
	\item P-task 2: Given three movies, P-subjects were asked to recommend the a fourth. 
		\begin{itemize}
				\item C-task 2: Find the movie which was recommended by the P-subject. The movies provided to the C-subjects were Catch me if you can, E.T.: The extra-terrestrial and Captain Phillips.
			\end{itemize}
	\item P-task 3: Ranking collaboration between a director and three actors. 
		\begin{itemize}
				\item C-task 3: Finding the three actors. The director James Cameron was mentioned but not the actors to the C-subjects. 
			\end{itemize}
	\item P-task 4: Finding five commonalities between pairs of movies. 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item C-task 4: Finding those commonalities. The instance of Raiders of the lost ark and Indiana Jones: The Last Crusade was provided to the C-subjects. 
			\end{itemize}
	\item Additional C-task 234: Given the data of P-task 2, 3 and 4 mixed together, the C-subjects were asked to find which P-task starts at which time for a particular P-subject.
\end{itemize}

To identify the tasks, the C-subjects needed to be trained about theose movies and actors. We let the C-subjects browse imdb.com for around 10 minutes. We divided our C-study in to two parts: offline and real-time. Six C-subjects participated in the offline part and five C-subjects took part in the real-time part. In the offline part data of five P-subjects were shown. The C-subjects were able to interact with the visualization tool. All the C-tasks described above were part of the offline part. On the other hand, in the real-time part C-subjects were unable to interact with the visualization tool. The data was streamed in real time and C-subjects were asked to perform C-task 234, C-task 2, C-task 3, and C-task 4. In the real-time the data consists of four P-subjects. All of the C-subjects user study session were recorded with their voice and screen video.  The offline part took longer time than real-time part. All of C-subjects were awarded \$10 for their time.
