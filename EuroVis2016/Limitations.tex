\section{Limitations}
1.	The DOI properties discussed in this paper are treated as simple unary values (ex: (x,y) coords would be a single value, not a pair of coordinates) without interactions with them. We do not aim to fully capture the relationships of the DOIs. For example, two actors may be linked by having acted in the same movie, and this link might be apparent in the original visualization that the DOIs were captured in but this relationship will not be visible in the DOI visualization. In the future work we might want to be able to do that. How would we do it?
2.	We are considering that each DOI is independent of another DOI and that a user can only see one DOI at a time. In fact, you could have DOI within DOIs (so a user can look at both the parent and children DOIs), and a user might be regularly see multiple DOIs at the same time.
