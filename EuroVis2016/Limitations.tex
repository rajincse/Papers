\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:Limitations}
DOI data can enable data driven, exploratory eye-tracking research not previously possible, by supporting long ``in vivo'' experiments of complex and interactive visual content. However, to unlock these benefits new visualization and analytics designs need to be developed. These need to handle the large scale typical of DOI data, show and leverage the rich attributes set that can characterize each DOI, and support DOI specific tasks. This paper creates a foundation for such research by formalizing DOI data and tasks, identifying challenges in supporting DOI analyses visually, and proposing design solutions to address these challenges.
